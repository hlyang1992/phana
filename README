phana

This program reads the binary file created by fix_phonon
and helps to analyse the phonon related info.

I replace the clapack library with intel mkl library, which is needed to solve the eigen problems.

The tricubic library is also needed to to tricubic interpolations,
which is inclued in the source directory.

The spglib (version 0.7.1) is optionally needed, enabling one to
evaluate the phonon density of states or vibrational thermal
properties using only the irreducible q-points in the first
Brillouin zone.

To compile the code, one needs therefore to install the above
libraries and set the paths correctly in the Makefile.

The units of the output frequencies by this code is THz for
LAMMPS units "real", "si", "metal", and "cgs"; in these cases,
the frequencies are $\nu$ instead of $\omega$.
